First entry - time to get up and running!

I'm not quite sure as to how to approach this as I can't remember the last time anything I've written has been published anywhere, if it ever actually has been...

My initial plan is to make some notes and take some pictures every day that I'm away and take some time each evening to edit these thoughts into a post using the pictures taken. As an aside I can have a look into the technology I could use to push out these updates (first attempts are going via github/jekyll).

What actually happened today:

# the taxi driver who picked me up this morning was the nephew of my flat's previous occupant, who sold it rather than renovating himself. Weird!
# breakfast on the plane was hot but rather unappetizing. oven roasted mushrooms > oven roasted scrambled eggs
# took a bit of a wander finding the hotel so I could drop off my bags before heading to the office
# met with the project team
# met the Finance RAD team who I've been working with remotely for a few months
# did a interview
# ate 2 slices of dominos pizza for the cheap price of Â£1
# wandered around the other office for the rest of the day, hit the pub, mexican resturant for dinner, then back to the hotel to prepare for "Day 1"

Lets to this thing! :|
